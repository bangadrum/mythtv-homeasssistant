# MythTV Home Assistant Integration

A custom integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that connects to your **MythTV** backend via the [MythTV Services API](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Services_API) and exposes useful information as sensors and binary sensors.

---

## Features

| Entity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Backend Connected | Binary Sensor | Whether the MythTV backend is reachable |
| Currently Recording | Binary Sensor | `on` when any tuner is actively recording |
| Recording Conflicts | Binary Sensor | `on` when scheduling conflicts exist |
| All Encoders Busy | Binary Sensor | `on` when every tuner is in use |
| Active Recordings | Sensor | Count of current recordings + details in attributes |
| Next Recording | Sensor | Title of the next scheduled recording |
| Next Recording Start | Sensor | Timestamp of the next scheduled recording |
| Upcoming Recordings | Sensor | Total count of upcoming recordings |
| Total Recordings | Sensor | Size of recorded library |
| Last Recorded | Sensor | Most recently recorded title |
| Recording Schedules | Sensor | Number of active recording rules |
| Total Encoders | Sensor | Number of capture cards |
| Storage Groups | Sensor | Count + used/free space per storage group |
| Backend Hostname | Sensor | MythTV host profile name + version |

All sensors expose rich **extra_state_attributes** (viewable in Developer Tools → States) with full programme details, schedules, encoder states, and storage group statistics.

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, click **Custom repositories** and add this repo with category **Integration**.
2. Search for *MythTV* and install.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/mythtv/` folder into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **MythTV**.
3. Fill in:
   - **Host** – IP address or hostname of the machine running `mythbackend`.
   - **Port** – default `6544`.
   - **Upcoming recordings to track** – how many upcoming entries to fetch (1–50, default 10).
   - **Recent recordings to track** – how many recorded entries to fetch (1–50, default 10).

> **Note:** All MythTV timestamps are UTC. Home Assistant will convert them to your local timezone automatically for `timestamp` device-class sensors.

## Example Automations

### Notify when a recording starts
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "MythTV recording started"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.mythtv_currently_recording
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "🔴 MythTV Recording"
          message: >
            Now recording:
            {{ state_attr('binary_sensor.mythtv_currently_recording', 'titles') | join(', ') }}
```

### Alert on scheduling conflicts
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "MythTV conflict alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.mythtv_recording_conflicts
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: persistent_notification.create
        data:
          title: "MythTV Conflict"
          message: >
            {{ states('sensor.mythtv_recording_conflicts') }} recording conflict(s) detected.
```

### Show next recording in a dashboard card
```yaml
type: entities
title: MythTV
entities:
  - entity: binary_sensor.mythtv_currently_recording
  - entity: sensor.mythtv_next_recording
  - entity: sensor.mythtv_next_recording_start
  - entity: sensor.mythtv_upcoming_recordings
  - entity: sensor.mythtv_recording_conflicts
  - entity: sensor.mythtv_active_recordings
```
